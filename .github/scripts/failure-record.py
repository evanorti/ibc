"""Build the failure record that the check job hands to the repair job.

The record is the whole interface between the run that found the break and the
agents that answer for it. It is written down rather than rediscovered so that
the repair job reproduces the failure CI actually saw -- an intermittent page
would otherwise send the fixer chasing a different failure than the one
reported -- and so there is something to read when the repair itself
misbehaves.

docci prints two failure shapes in its "=== Validation Errors ===" section:
  - checkpoint mismatch: "... does not match the expected output ..." followed
    by "Expected:" and "Actual output:" blocks
  - output-contains: 'output does not contain "..."' followed by "Actual output:"
A third shape has no validation section at all: a COMMAND failure, where a step
exits non-zero (a renamed flag, a removed subcommand). docci then logs only
"Executing CMD: ..." lines and "Unexpected script execution failure
error=exit status N". It is recorded as a failure of kind "command" (see
parse_command_failure for the dedup rule); validation failures are kind
"validation". Every failure is recorded in `failures` (first ten;
`failures_omitted` counts the rest). The top-level step/expected/actual repeat
failures[0]. docci colours its log
lines with ANSI escapes, which are stripped before parsing and from the stored log (so `log` is not
byte-identical to docci's output; the raw bytes live in the CI run).
